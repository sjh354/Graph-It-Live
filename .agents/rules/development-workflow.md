# Development Workflow and Tools

Apply this file by explicit routing for shell-heavy work, repository exploration, refactoring, or codemap maintenance even when no matched file is open.

## RTK

- Prefix shell commands with `rtk`: `rtk git status`, `rtk npm test`, `rtk cargo test`, `rtk docker ps`, `rtk kubectl get pods`.
- Use `rtk proxy <command>` when no optimized wrapper exists.
- Use `rtk gain`, `rtk gain --history`, and `rtk discover` to inspect savings and missed opportunities.

## Graph-It-Live

- **Mandatory first step for JavaScript-family code exploration:** for `.js`, `.jsx`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.cts`, and `.mts` files, use the available Graph-It-Live MCP tools before directly reading or searching source files. Start with index status or workspace architecture, then use targeted dependency, caller, file-logic, symbol, or trace queries.
- Direct source inspection with `read_file`, `rg`, or equivalent is a follow-up step: use it to verify implementation details, resolve gaps, and prepare edits after the Graph-It-Live pass. Do not replace the initial Graph-It-Live analysis with direct reading.
- Run the `rebuild_index` MCP tool after source changes to refresh the index.
- For broad feature/refactor/audit work, take one workspace snapshot with `explore_architecture` and reuse its counts, then run targeted codemap/call-graph/file-logic queries.

## Ponytail: lazy senior developer

Stop at first rung that solves requirement correctly:

1. Confirm feature is needed (YAGNI).
2. Reuse existing helper, utility, or pattern.
3. Prefer standard library.
4. Prefer native platform feature.
5. Prefer already-installed dependency.
6. Collapse to one clear line when possible.
7. Only then write minimum new code.

Understand full flow first. Trace callers and fix shared root cause once, not symptom per caller.

- No unrequested abstractions, dependencies, or boilerplate.
- Prefer deletion, boring solutions, and fewest files.
- Smallest correct diff wins; preserve security, accessibility, validation, error handling, and explicit requirements.
- When choosing equally small approaches, choose edge-case-correct one.
- Mark deliberate simplifications with known ceilings using `ponytail:` comment naming ceiling and upgrade path.
- Non-trivial logic needs smallest runnable check that fails when behavior breaks; trivial one-liners need no test.

## Git and Pull Requests

- Use repository Conventional Commit style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.).
- Run the review agent (diff vs the issue's acceptance criteria) on the local branch and apply its findings before the first push: every push starts GitHub Actions, so a review fix after the PR wastes a CI run.
- PR descriptions include concise summary, commands and outcomes for validation, screenshots/GIFs for webview UI changes, and relevant issue links.
- Never claim check passed without running it in current session.
